        - **NO NET FORCE**
        - **There is a NET TORQUE** 
    - The net torque that appears on the rectangular loop can be determined with the help of the Right Hand Rule (RHR), when applied to the bottom and the top parts of the rectangular loop.
    - The magnetic moment of the loop is directory proportional with the strength of the current within the loop, and the enclosing surface area.
        - $$\mathbf{\mu}=I\cdot A$$
            - $$A$$ is the surface area
            - $$I$$ is the current __running__ through the loop
        - **The direction of $$\mathbf{\mu}$$ is given by the right hand rule**.
        - The torque of the loop depends on the angle between the **magnetic flux density** $$\vec{B}$$ and the magnetic moment $$\vec{\mu}$$.
- ## **Magnetic force**
    - The magnetic field $$\vec{B}$$ is defined from the **Lorentz Force Law**, from the magnetic force on a moving charge:
        - $$\vec{F}=q\vec{v}\times\vec{B}$$
        - From the formula above, the following implications appear:
            - The force is **perpendicular** to both the **velocity** of the charge and the **magnetic field**.
            - The magnitude of the force is $$F=qvB\sin\theta$$, where $$\theta$$ is the angle between the velocity and the magnetic field.
            - **The magnetic force on a stationary charge or a charge moving parallel to the magnetic field is ZERO**
        - The direction of the force is given by the right hand rule.

    - Both the electric field $$\vec{E}$$ and the magnetic field $$\vec{B}$$ can be defined from the Lorentz Force Law:
        - $$\vec{F}=q\vec{E}+q\vec{v}\times\vec{B}$$
            - First term of the formula is the electric force of a charge q
            - Second term is the magnetic force of a charge q
        - The electric force has the direction of the electric field if the charge q is positive.
        - The direction of the magnetic force is given by the right hand rule.

- **The magnetic torque on a current loop**
    - Any wire loop carrying current experiences no net force, but there is generally a net torque acting that tends to make the loop rotate.
