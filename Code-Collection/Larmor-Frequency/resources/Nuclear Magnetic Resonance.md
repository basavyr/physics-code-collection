- The nucleus of an atom has:
    - a positive net charge
    - a nuclear spin
    - an effective magnetic dipole moment of the nucleus due to its **spinning protons**.
    - The spin is an __intrinsic__ property of the protons inside the nucleus.
- The magnetic dipole moment of any nucleus is randomly oriented in space.
- When the nucleus is placed inside an **external magnetic field**,  the nucleus will experience a **torque** due to the **interaction of the magnetic dipole moment with the external magnetic field**.
    - This will result in two possible orientations of the nuclear magnetic dipole
        - Spin up
        - Spin down
- In NMR, a very strong magnetic field is used to create such an orientation.
    - A radio wave signal is used to induce __spin flips__ between the up and down situations.
    - The energy difference between the two orientations is given from the expression for the energy of a magnetic dipole in a field:
        - $$U=-\vec{\mu}\cdot\vec{B}$$
    - The difference between the spin up and down nucleus has an energy 
        - $$\Delta U=2\mu_B B$$.
    - The induced radio signal must match this energy difference to be absorbed (resonance condition).
    - The component of $$\vec{\mu}$$ along the magnetic field $$B$$ is constant, but the local magnetic field at the site of the nucleus may depend on its local environment, since the other atoms nearby may produce small B themselves due to their circulating currents.
