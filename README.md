# Physics
## Code Collection 💻 📦

A collection of Physics Concepts applied to different numerical implementations using the Python programming language.

## Workflow

Each implementation represents a certain physics topic (e.g., nuclear physics, plasma physics, laser physics and so on) that is organized in its own directory. For every implementation, there are the following folders:

* `code`: stores the actual code with the implementation itself.
* `resources`: a place used for storing documents with the theory used for the development process.
