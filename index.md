*A collection of physics problems implemented in various programming languages📚*.

This is the main web-page dedicated for my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/basavyr/physics-code-collection), where I develop solutions to different concepts that are related to Physics (mainly Nuclear Physics, Quantum Mechanics, and more).

## Workflow

📘 The entire repository is organized in so-called *sub-projects*, where each sub-project represents a certain problem linked to a concept from Nuclear Structure, Quantum Mechanics etc. Every sub-project directory contains resources that were used for the development process of the numerical implementations, and the actual implementation/codebase.

⚙️ In terms of programming languages used for solving the problems, they consist in `Python`, `C++` and `Wolfram Mathematica`.
